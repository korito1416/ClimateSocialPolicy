    "We start by considering a simple production-based model with an AK production technology subject to adjustment costs.  By design, this formulation has  close ties to much of the long-run risk with consumption exogenously specified consumption endowments.  Prior to introducing climate change, we include two modifications.  First, we include an energy input in way that is mathematically similar to what is used in so called ``DICE'' models; and second, we allow for R\\&D that could eventually remove the need for energy input.  In regards to the second modification,  some suggest that an economically viable version of nuclear fusion might achieve this aim. \n",
