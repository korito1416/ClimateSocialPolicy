    "In this paper, we derive social valuations and uncertainty contributions that underlie robustly optimal policy actions in response to the economic consequences of climate change. Characterizing the potential long-run risks of climate change has become a focal point for economic and policy analysis.  An influential literature in macro-asset pricing studies the potential impact of long-term macroeconomic uncertainty on current-period valuation. See, for example, :cite:t:BansalYaron:2004 and the subsequent literature.   While motivated by insights from this literature, our contribution differs in two important ways.  First, we study the long-term uncertainty associated with climate change.  This leads us to explore specific structures of this uncertainty from multiple sources as it impacts a production-based model.  Second, we study valuation from a social perspective rather than a market perspective.  These two perspectives differ because of production externalities. We adopt the social vantage point  because climate change induced by human activity is at the forefront of many policy discussions. The counterpart to asset prices in our analysis are i) the social cost of climate change and ii) the social value of research and development of new viable clean technologies.  The social perspective that we feature provides a valuable benchmark for effectiveness of  *ad hoc* policies implemented in market settings.\n",

    "> The economic consequences of many of the complex risks associated with climate change cannot, however, currently be quantified.  ... these unquantified, poorly understood and often deeply uncertain risks can and should be included in economic evaluations and decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we do not take up the full challenge posed by uncertainties featured by \\cite{RisingTedescoPionekStainforth:2022}, we do propose an approach for confronting so called ``deep uncertainty'' that is formally integrated into policy analysis. We demonstrate the value of such an approach in focusing on uncertainty in four inputs into prudent climate policy making:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *carbon-climate dynamics* mapping from carbon emissions into temperature changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- *economic damage functions* reductions in output because of changes in atmospheric temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *technological innovation* future abatement cost reductions for CO2-based energy  through investment in research and development(R\\& D).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *investment productivity* exogenous shifts in the capital evolution  that have persistent consequences.\n",
    "\n",

    "The fourth of these shocks captures the familiar ``long-run risk'' contributions to the macroeconomy in the absences of climate change and provides a benchmark for comparison.  The other three are explicitly linked to climate change and contribute to our analysis in specific ways.  We capture these with both Brownian and jump risk components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We push beyond the usual risk-based analyses by taking a broad approach to uncertainty, consistent with perspectives from multiple fields, including decision and control theory. These literatures formalize sagacious responses to alternative types of uncertainty, including *risk* within a model(unknown outcomes with known probabilities), *ambiguity* across models(unknown priors weighting alternative models or parameter configurations), and potential *model misspecification*\n",
    "(unknown flaws of fully specified probability models). The latter of these three constructs gives a way to formulate concepts such as ``deep uncertainty'', or ``radical uncertainty'', that are present in many policy discussions.  While there are many references to these concepts, as evident from the call in our quote from \\cite{RisingTedescoPionekStainforth:2022}, there is little in the way of addressing these uncertainties in a formal way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also  borrow and extend insights from asset pricing theory to study two social assets: i) the *social cost of global warming* and ii) the *social value of research and development* (R\\& D) capital for developing new green technologies.  We think of both of these as assets characterized by their implied intertemporal social cash flows.  The asset price representations depend on a ``tilted probability'' distribution that reflects aversion to model ambiguity or model misspecification. While \\cite{BarnettBrockHansen:2020} focused exclusively on the uncertainty contribution to the social price of global warming, in this paper we are also interested in the implications of uncertainty for the  social value of the stock of  R\\& D  directed at the discovery of  new and economically viable green technologies.  But even the social cost of global warming is altered by our inclusion of R\\& D investment in the toolkit of the social planner, modifying some of previous analyses in a substantive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, in this paper we consider a discounted dynamic decision problem under uncertainty for a fictitious social planner.  We  introduce the problem  to construct a benchmark target for *ad hoc* policies.  There is scope for such policies to be socially productive  because of the failure of the ``invisible hand.'' Market solutions do not account for the  climate change externality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our fictitious social planner setting, this paper provides a novel decomposition to assess which uncertainty components are most consequential for policy related to climate change. To achieve this, we propose and implement refinements to uncertainty quantification methods. Our approach is based explicitly on a  decision theory perspective.    We solve alternative decision problems with different configurations of uncertainty, each featuring  a specific source of the uncertainty.   By varying the hypothetical exposure to the uncertainty, we show which of the four sources of uncertainty has the biggest impact on the prudent decisions of the planner.\n"
