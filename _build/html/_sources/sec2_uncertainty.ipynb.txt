    "Under a baseline probability specification, $W  := \\{ W_t : t \\ge 0\\}$ is a multivariate standard Brownian motion,  and ${\\mathfrak F}  := \\{ {\\mathfrak F}_t : t \\ge 0\\}$ is the corresponding information filtration with $\\mathfrak{F}_t$ generated information that is realized between dates zero and t. This information includes the Brownian increments that have been realized up to date $t$.  Initially, we let ${\\mathfrak F}$ be the Brownian filtration, but we subsequently will augment this filtration to include realizations of jumps that will influence technology and damages induced by climate change.\n",

From Girsanov theory, such martingales can be characterized  by their implied drift distortions.
